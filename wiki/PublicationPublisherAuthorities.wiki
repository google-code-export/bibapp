#summary Publication and Publisher authority control (DRAFT)

== Publication / Publisher Authorities ==

We'll start with the simple case.  For Publications and Publishers, we collect every string variant of their names:

*Note*: It's probably a very good idea to compare based on a cleaned version of the authority values, to eliminate matches missed because of capitalization and punctuation. Things of the form "American Institute of Physics" to "americaninstituteofphysics":

{{{
name.gsub!(/[^A-Za-z0-9]+/, '').downcase!
}}}

=== Publisher Example ===

  # American Institute of Physics
  # AMER INST PHYSICS
  # American Institute of Physics Inc
  # AIP
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, NY 11747-4502, United States
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Inst of Physics, Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, United States

Each Publisher record contains an "authority_id" field, where we can self-join to the chosen authority record.  In the case above, "American Institute of Physics" is the chosen authority record, so each record below can reference #1 in their authority_id field.

The same simple technique can be applied to Publication records.

=== Publication Example ===

  # Acta Astronaut. | 0094-5765
  # Acta Astronaut. (UK) | 0094-5765
  # Acta Astronautica | 0094-5765

Here "Acta Astronautica" is the chosen authority record, so each record above #3 can reference #3 in their authority_id field.
