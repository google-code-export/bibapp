#Capistrano installation

= Introduction =

Capistrano is a tool that makes it easy to deploy and update applications on remote servers. We have set Bibapp up so that you can use Capistrano to manage your Bibapp
deployment.

This guide is still rough.

== Configure Capistrano ==

  # Install capistrano on your development machine. You can do this by doing:

{{{
 gem install capistrano
}}}

  # Edit capistrano deployment file

Copy config/deploy.rb.template to config/deploy.rb in your development machine. Here are a variety of settings that control how Capistrano will control your deployment. You'll need to change some of the settings marked with 'set' or 'role'. Important ones include:

  * set :deploy_to - change to the directory on your server where you want Bibapp to live
  * set :user - change to the user that will be running Bibapp on the server. You will need for the ssh public key from your development machine to be in the authorized_keys for this user on the server
  * role :web, role :app, role :db - in a typical Bibapp installation these may all be set to the same machine; however, the main web server (e.g. Apache running passenger), application server(s) (the actual running instances of Rails with Bibapp loaded up), and database server(s) may be different.

This should be all you need to do, but Capistrano has other settings if you need them.
