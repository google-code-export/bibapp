#summary Describes the Citation Import Process for BibApp

= Introduction =

Citation management starts with the import of new citations.  This page details how to load citations into BibApp.  It details the citation parsing and processing that occurs behind the scenes, as well as the beginning of the citation lifecycle.

= Import Formats =

!BibApp currently accepts the following citation import formats:
  * *[http://www.refworks.com/ RefWorks] XML* (deprecated) - This XML export format has been _deprecated_ by !RefWorks.  This deprecated XML format is _different_ from the new "!RefWorks XML Format", which is much more difficult to parse consistently.  We are looking into a replacement !RefWorks export format, since this older XML format will soon be obsolete.
  * *[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/ PubMed's] MEDLINE format*
  * *[http://www.refman.com/support/risformat_intro.asp RIS] format*

!BibApp also supports manual entry of citations through a Citation web form.  There are already plans to support further formats, so feel free to make suggestions!

The citation parsers and importers for the above formats were developed specifically for BibApp.  They are available in the `/vendor/plugins/` directory when you download !BibApp.  Once they are more stable, they will likely also be available as Rails Plugins.
