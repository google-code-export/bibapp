#summary Authority work in the BibApp

= Introduction =

Citation data is ugly.  We need to create authority records for Authors, Publications and Publishers.


= Details =

Citation data collected for 48 People in the Engineering Physics department at UW-Madison produces:

  * 4512 unique Author records
  * 1282 unique Publication records
  * 0431 unique Publisher records
  * 3053 unique Citation records

== Publication / Publisher Authorities ==

We'll start with the simple case.  For Publications and Publishers, we collect every string variant of their names:

=== Publisher Example ===

  # American Institute of Physics
  # AMER INST PHYSICS
  # American Institute of Physics Inc
  # AIP
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, NY 11747-4502, United States
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Inst of Physics, Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, United States

Each Publisher record contains an "authority_id" field, where we can self-join to the chosen authority record.  In the case above, "American Institute of Physics" is the chosen authority record, so each record below can reference #1 in their authority_id field.

The same simple technique can be applied to Publication records.

=== Publication Example ===

  # Acta Astronaut. | 0094-5765
  # Acta Astronaut. (UK) | 0094-5765
  # Acta Astronautica | 0094-5765

Here "Acta Astronautica" is the chosen authority record, so each record above #3 can reference #3 in their authority_id field.

== Author Authorities ==

Author authorities are much more difficult.  In the BibApp's new architecture, we no longer add Citations to the application via Authors to produce Authorships.  Now we simply load Citation data collected for people at our institution.  Each Citation is processed to discover the individual Author names associated with the Citation.

=== Citation Example ===

Dong, Liang, Jiang, Hongrui. (2007). Autonomous microfluidics with stimuli-responsive hydrogels. Soft Matter, 3(10), 1223-1230.

The two author stings above are:

  * Dong, Liang
  * Jiang, Hongrui

=== Workflow ===

I'll use myself as an example:

User name: Eric William Larson

I login to the BibApp for the first time and the website asks me to select my Author names.  I type in my last name to filter the Author index.  Here's what I see:

Potential Author variants:

  * Larson, D
  * Larson, E
  * Larson, EW
  * Larson, E.W.
  * Larson, Eric W.
  * Larson, Eric WM.
  * Larson, Eric William 
  * Larson, F

Maybe all the Larson, E* are correct (I have published under all these names), so I select the checkbox next to each name variant.  Lastly, I select one of these variants as my "preferred" name: Larson, E.W.
