#summary Authority work in the BibApp

= Introduction =

Citation data is ugly.  We need to create authority records for Authors, Publications and Publishers.


= Details =

Citation data collected for 48 People in the Engineering Physics department at UW-Madison produces:

  * 4512 unique Author records
  * 1282 unique Publication records
  * 0431 unique Publisher records
  * 3053 unique Citation records

== Publication / Publisher Authorities ==

We'll start with the simple case.  For Publications and Publishers, we collect every string variant of their names:

=== Publisher Example ===

  # American Institute of Physics
  # AMER INST PHYSICS
  # American Institute of Physics Inc
  # AIP
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, NY 11747-4502, United States
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Inst of Physics, Woodbury, NY, USA
  # American Institute of Physics Inc., Melville, United States

Each Publisher record contains an "authority_id" field, where we can self-join to the chosen authority record.  In the case above, "American Institute of Physics" is the chosen authority record, so each record below can reference #1 in their authority_id field.

The same simple technique can be applied to Publication records.

== Author Authorities ==

Author authorities are much more difficult.  In the BibApp's new architecture, Users will select a list of their "author" names.  I'll use myself as an example:

User name: Eric William Larson

I login to the BibApp for the first time and the website asks me to select my Author names.  I type in my last name to filter the Author index.  Here's what I see:

Potential Author variants:

  * Larson, E
  * Larson, EW
  * Larson, E.W.
  * Larson, Eric W.
  * Larson, Eric WM.
  * Larson, Eric William 

Maybe they are all correct (I have published under all these names), so I select the checkbox next to each name variant.  Lastly, I select one of these variants as my "preferred" name: Larson, E.W.
