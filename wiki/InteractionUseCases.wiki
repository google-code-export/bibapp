#summary A brainstormed list of ways to interact with the BibApp.

= Personas =

In Alan Cooper style, here is a list of named characters we might expect to interact with the BibApp:

*Dr. Helen Troia: Assistant Professor, Department of Basketology*

Dr. Troia is going up for tenure next year. She hopes that the BibApp will help her prepare her CV for her tenure package. She already uses it to keep her departmental webpage up-to-date, as she has very little time to update the page herself. Dr. Troia has heard vaguely that open access threatens her favorite publisher, but does not have strong opinions on the subject herself.

*Cassandra Athens: Webmaster, Department of Basketology*

Cassandra just started maintaining the Basketology websites. She is eager to help Basketology put its best face forward, though the new web-design guidelines coming down from the university's communications department cramp her style. Whatever the BibApp can easily do to reduce Cassandra's workload is welcome -- but Cassandra warns you, it had better work with her existing content management system!

*Menelaus Fox: liaison librarian to the Department of Basketology*

The Basketology department is coming up for reaccreditation soon, and Menelaus is tasked with evaluating the library's Basketology collection, and bolstering it where necessary. He is interested to know where Basketology faculty publish. Menelaus is not very tech-savvy, and he is perennially pressed for time. He doesn't know anything about open access or self-archiving.

*Ulysses Acqua: manager, university library's DSpace repository*

Ulysses knows he must fill the repository he runs as quickly as possible if he is to keep his job. He is an enthusiastic booster of open access. He has a reasonable level of technical savvy, but DSpace confuses him at times.

= Interactions =

  * An automatically-updated list of publications for a faculty member's website. Should be style-able and usable with generic CMSes (Cassandra, Helen)
    * Citation groupings? 
    * Like Feed2JS? 
    * What about citation styles -- could leverage Zotero citation export code? 
    * Preferences - Choose a format and preview the results.
    * No auth necessary for the export piece; many different people on campus will want the exported info.
    * What about server load? Caching? Updated nightly? Asynchronous workers (via cron)?
    * Building random collections of cites, perhaps via faceted search/browse.
    * RSS feeds!
  * A well-formatted list of publications to be imported into word-processing software for a CV. (Helen)
  * A report of the journals Basketology faculty have published in (Menelaus)
  * Adding a new faculty member to the department's BibApp instance; previous publications must be imported, a new faculty webpage generated, and photo and descriptive information added (Helen, Cassandra, Menelaus?)
  * Adding publications to a faculty member's BibApp site as they appear (Helen, Menelaus)
    * Encoding for cut-and-pasted citations?
  * Searching the Basketology department for interesting new research (Helen, outsiders)
  * Receiving a feed or emailed notification of new research based on defined search terms (Helen)
  * Automatically notifying a faculty member by email that a preprint or postprint is eligible for repository deposit (Ulysses or Menelaus)
  * Easily adding a preprint or postprint for deposit into the repository, with all necessary embargoes handled automatically (Helen)
