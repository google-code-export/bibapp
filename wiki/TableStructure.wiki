== Basic Table Structure ==

  * Authorships
  * Citations
  * Publications
  * Publishers
  * Tags
  * Taggings
  * Users

=== TODO - Tables to better understand ===

  * DataSources - What attrs do we need to capture here?

  * Blacklists - polymorphic association, allows a User to "blacklist" another class (Publications, Authors, Keywords, etc...) so an Author record will not incorrectly assume a positive Authorship: "I never publish in Nature, don't make this mistake again", "I never publish with Larson, E.W., don't make this mistake again", "I don't write about Thin Films, never assume I wrote an article about Thin Films again".

  * Blacklistings - Polymorphic bridge for Blacklisted items
