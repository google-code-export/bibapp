  * *Citations (Anyone | ASAP)*
    * *Bug* - Some bad publication date years (ex. 6) cause the citations/edit form's publication date year select options to range badly (ex. 1950-11)

      * ~~Add rows param to filters~~
      * ~~Add rows param to search form select options~~
      * `"Nano*"` and `"nano*"` return different results!?!
      * ~~*Bug* Sorting results when there is multiple filters results in the filters being combined into one filter.~~
      * *Bug* The year filter gives back results with years other than that of the filter.

    * *Missing Features:*
      * Advanced Search?
      * XSLT2RSS?

  * *SHERPA RoMEO data (Eric)*
    * *Frozen for 0.7 release - 2008.06.02*
    * Sherpa's api data is not cached on their server
    * net/http will *always* timeout
    * added /public/sherpa/publishers.xml file
    * Publisher.update_sherpa_data method groks over this xml file
    * Update will have to be via a manual download
    * We'll include a local copy in BibApp truck

  * *Styles / IA (Ongoing | Eric)*
    * Groups index
    * People index
    * Print CSS (started...)

  * *Terminology (June | Everyone?)*
    * Remove 'citation' terminology...replace with 'research'?

  * *Views (Ongoing | Everyone?)*
    * Homepage (Citations/index): On Firefox 2 on Mac, the &heart; shows up as a vertical pipe (e.g. | )
    * Admin view
    * People/index view should allow filtering via group_id
    * Groups/index view should allow filtering via (parent_group_id)
    * Groups/index view: Parent/Child groups presentation
    * Citations/show view: Abstract / keywords show when copyright is clear
    * ~~Citations/apa templates: Create APA templates for all Citation types (or at least a "default" APA template which can be used if a type-specific one isn't found)~~
    * ~~Citations/forms templates: Create edit/new forms for all Citation types (or at least a "default" form which can be used if a type-specific one isn't found)~~
    * ~~Publishers/new view: Cleanup? - especially giant select box~~
    * ~~Publications/new view: Cleanup? - especially giant select box~~
    * ~~Publication lists (in general):  Is there anyway to filter out the "Unknown" publication name which appears for Books?~~
    * Person/new view: Cleanup? - ~~put LDAP search at Top~~
    * PenNames/new view: Suggestions are totally wacky... remove initial last_name search?
    * ~~Contributorships View: *Bug* - Clicking "verify" next to two citations in a row ends displays an RJS Error (even though the verification actually seems to work)~~
    * Memberships/index view: should list memberships for ?person_id=2, or even better, show memberships for memberships/2-Matthew_S_Allen
    * Contributorships : It'd be nice to have a way to check multiple citations and click "Verify" or "Deny" once.  It's a bit of a pain to go one-by-one when you know multiple are either valid or not.


  * *Person*
    * ~~*Bug* - editing Group/Memberships (ex. adding a title) throws the :after_save methods to update all Person.citation in Solr ~~
    * *Possible Bug* - Updating all Preson.citations in Solr does not happen when a membership is deleted.

  * *Group*
    * *Bug* Deleting a group does *not* delete the groups corresponding memberships, causing many errors.

  * *Membership*
    * A person should be allowed to have multiple memberships to the same group.  This will require some new logic.  Currently throughout the application it is required that there only be one membership for each person and group.
    * ~~*Bug*: Adding a title to a membership does not save.  This is cause by Permissions. In the method "edit_time" in the memberships controller, the call to 'permit'  does not allow an update, even if you should have permission.~~

  * *Citation ingest (June? | Conference call)*
    * Implement simple pubmed API ingest
    * Implement simple ISI ingest
    * Implement simple arXiv API
    * ~~Add newer RefWorks XML format~~
    * Better error handling for bulk ingest!  Currently, if one citation errors out, the entire bulk ingest process halts.  It'd be better to note which citations error, and provide an error report at the end of the bulk import.

  * *Tests (Ongoing | Everyone?)*
    * Add Fixtures
    * Write functional tests for all controllers
    * Write unit tests for all models
