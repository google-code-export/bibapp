===Citation ingest===

  * Implement simple arXiv API
  * Implement simple pubmed API ingest
  * Implement simple ISI ingest
  * Re-Implement import for newer RefWorks format.  The old XML format is now marked as deprecated.  Maybe we can import the RefWorks "tagged" format?  Or BibTeX?
  * Citation Parser will throw a "ran out of buffer space" error if you attempt to bulk load a large number of citations at once
