#summary The 1.0 TODO List
#labels Phase-Design

=== !BibApp 1.0 Todo: ===

  * Item (Timeframe | Owner)

  * Documentation (June | Everyone)
    * Rails
    * Solr
    * SVN export
    * Installation - Started at [Installation]
      * Personalization
      * Hpricot (compiled C code)
    * SHERPA RoMEO

  * Search (Eric)
    * Frozen for 0.7 release - 2008.06.02
    * List only bugs here, not features...
    * Advanced Search?

  * Styles (Ongoing | Eric)
    * Groups index
    * People index

  * Views (Ongoing | Everyone?)
    * Admin view
    * People/index view should allow filtering via group_id
    * Groups/index view should allow filtering via (parent_group_id)
    * Groups/index view: Parent/Child groups presentation
    * Groups/show view: *Bug* - Publisher and Publication links to link directly to filtered set of Publisher / Group related citations
    * Citations/show view: Abstract / keywords show when copyright is clear
    * Citations/index view: way to browse/filter a list of all Citations directly?
    * Citations/apa templates: Create APA templates for all Citation types (or at least a "default" APA template which can be used if a type-specific one isn't found)
    * Citations/forms templates: Create edit/new forms for all Citation types (or at least a "default" form which can be used if a type-specific one isn't found)
    * Publishers/new view: Cleanup? - especially giant select box
    * Publications/new view: Cleanup? - especially giant select box
    * Persion/new view: Cleanup? - ~~put LDAP search at Top~~
    * Contributorships View: *Bug* - Clicking "verify" next to two citations in a row ends displays an RJS Error (even though the verification actually seems to work)
    

  * Citation ingest (June? | Conference call)
    * Implement simple pubmed API ingest
    * Implement simple ISI ingest
    * Implement simple arXiv API
    * Add newer RefWorks XML format
    * Better error handling for bulk ingest!  Currently, if one citation errors out, the entire bulk ingest process halts.  It'd be better to note which citations error, and provide an error report at the end of the bulk import.

  * Tests (Ongoing | Everyone?)
    * Add Fixtures
    * Write functional tests for all controllers
    * Write unit tests for all models
