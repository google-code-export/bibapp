= Introduction =

The below instructions are based on a fresh installation of BibApp on Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  They should also work on 10.5 (Leopard), and I've added notes detailing some known differences on Leopard.

Before we begin, a few notes: 
  * These instructions are based on a MacBook Pro Install, for a basic development environment.  These instructions attempt to use as much pre-installed software as possible to simplify the install process.  Therefore, they may not be tailored to Production level installs on Mac OSX Servers.
  * You must be comfortable with using the Terminal (`/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`) to install Mac OSX.

    * Ruby 1.8.6 comes with Leopard (10.5)
    * Ruby 1.8.7 comes with Snow Leopard (10.6)
    * *NOTE:* Production installations should look into installing [http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/ Ruby Enterprise Edition] as it provides better stability and speed than basic Ruby.
