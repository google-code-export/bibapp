#summary Documentation on how to add people to BibApp

=How to Add People to !BibApp=

This page describes how to add people to !BibApp. It assumes that you have already configured your !BibApp to be hooked to your campus LDAP (see http://code.google.com/p/bibapp/wiki/Installation#4._Configure_BibApp for more information). 

Note that as of the current release (1.01) it is not possible to upload multiple people at once through the user interface.

As you start this process, it is helpful to have:

  * a list of researchers you wish to add (perhaps a departmental site, for example);
  * access to images of these researchers (if you wish to add those); and
  * the groups that the researchers are a part of. You may want to add these groups to !BibApp before you begin.

==Who Can Add People to !BibApp?==

  * Sitewide administrators
  * Admins of Groups
  * Editors of Groups

==Steps==

1. Log in to your !BibApp installation.

2. You can add people from two locations:

  * Click the Admin tab, then People, then Add a Person
  * Click the People tab, then Add a Person (in the bar under the main tabs)

3. At the New Person screen, you can search your LDAP for the researcher.

4. The LDAP search will present you with possible matches. You can select the appropriate one, and the directory information will be populated into !BibApp.

5. Note that depending on how your LDAP and !BibApp are configured, you may pull in more or less information. You can add more or change information at this point (such as the Research Profile or to change the Display Name) before saving.

6. After you save the personal information, you will be directed to the Pen Name page. !BibApp automatically creates possible pen names for the person based upon the information gathered via LDAP and entered at the personal information stage. !BibApp will also search its database to find any other possible pen names. 

 || *Note:* !BibApp's generation of pen names will only be as good as the information fed it; if a researcher publishes under another name (a maiden name, for example), but LDAP only has the researcher listed under a married name, there may not be matches found for the published pen name. You can add other pen names if you know them. ||
