#summary Documentation on how to add people to BibApp

=How to Add People to !BibApp=

This page describes how to add people to !BibApp. It assumes that you have already configured your !BibApp to be hooked to your campus LDAP (see http://code.google.com/p/bibapp/wiki/Installation#4._Configure_BibApp for more information). 

Note that as of the current release (1.01) it is not possible to upload multiple people at once through the user interface.

As you start this process, it is helpful to have:

  * a list of researchers you wish to add (perhaps a departmental site, for example);
  * access to images of these researchers (if you wish to add those); and
  * the groups that the researchers are a part of. You may want to add these groups to !BibApp before you begin.
