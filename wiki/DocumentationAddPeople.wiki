=How to Add People to !BibApp=

This page describes how to add people to !BibApp. It assumes that you have already configured your !BibApp to be hooked to your campus LDAP (see http://code.google.com/p/bibapp/wiki/Installation#4._Configure_BibApp for more information). Note that as of the current release (1.01) it is not possible to upload multiple people at once through the user interface.
