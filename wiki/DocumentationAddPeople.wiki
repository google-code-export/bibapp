On the *Photos* page you can upload a photo if you have one. Once you have browsed to the appropriate file, click the upload file button to upload the photo.

If you want to change the photo that is currently uploaded, simply upload a new photo.

==Groups==

On the *Groups* page you can add the person to as many groups as necessary. Note that adding a person to a subgroup will automatically give them membership in the parent group. Click the Join Selected Groups button to add the person to the groups.

Once you have clicked "Join Selected Groups" and the verification box, you will see the groups that the person is a member of, as well as space to indicate their role and the dates associated with the group. Click Save after adding each role and dates.

 || *Note:* As of the current (1.01) release of !BibApp, these dates do not have any function. There is a feature request in the Issue queue to add functionality that would make use of these dates, but no indication yet of the priority for this. ||

==Unverified Contributions==

If !BibApp has any works that it believes may belong to this person because of a pen name, it will list them here. You can verify or deny contributions one by one or in bulk.
