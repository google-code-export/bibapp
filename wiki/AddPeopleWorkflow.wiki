#A summary of how to add people to your !BibApp installation.

This page describes how to add people to your !BibApp installation. 

We find it helps to start with:

  - a list of researchers (on a department or center website for example)
  - access to images of faculty members
  - the groups that each faculty member belongs to and to have these groups already entered into !BibApp.
