#summary BibApp Project Roadmap

*TODO*: Expand this page.

==Version 1.0 - Requirements==

  * Authentication and Authorization
  * Citations
    * Citation ingest
    * Citation reuse
  * Time

===Authentication and Authorization===

   * Goals:
     # Simple Authorization
       * Preferable to use an existing Rails plugin or Ruby gem
       * Authorization "roles" will be assigned to "groups"
       * Assume no hierarchy to "groups", to keep things simple
     # Simple, but Dynamic Authentication
       * Preferable to use an existing Rails plugin or Ruby gem
       * Cannot "assume" any particular local authentication mechanism 

   * Recommendations:
     # Authorization
       * Use "[http://www.writertopia.com/developers/authorization Authorization plugin]", which seems to provide very clean [http://www.rubyinside.com/authorization-permissions-plugin-for-rails-154.html role-based authorization using dynamic methods].  Also seems to be highly recommended/respected.
       * Possible Roles (need better definition & agreement)
         * *Admin* - Overall BibApp Administrator
         * *Librarian* - Can perform all data-related tasks (e.g. add, remove, edit data)
         * *Editor* - Can edit or enter in new data
         * *Data-Entry* - Can only enter in new data
         * *Packager* - Can export citations into "packages" to prepare for a repository
     # Authentication
       * Use "[http://railscasts.com/episodes/67 restful_authentication]" plugin?


===Citations===

Read the [CitationModelRefactor] page to better understand the re-architecture for version 1.0.

====Citation ingest====

  * Goals:
    # Simple workflow for adding citations
    # Support for many citation types: Journal Article, Books, etc.
    # Support for common standards
    # Automated de-duplication
  * Success criteria:
    # One
    # Two
    # Three

=====Description=====

To be successful, the BibApp needs to be a robust citation repository first and foremost.  We need to ensure data ingest remains simple and intuitive, lowing the bar for participation and administration.


====Citation reuse====

  * Goals:
    # Goal 1
  * Success criteria:
    # Example

===Time===

==Version 2.0 - Suggested Features==

  * Interoperability
  * More SHERPA
  * Focus on current campus collaboration
  * Authorities
    * Author names
    * Journals / Sources
    * Publishers
  * Cited references?
