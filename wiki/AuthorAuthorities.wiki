#summary Author authority control (DRAFT ONLY)

== Introduction ==

Author authority control requires [https://mail2.cni.org/Lists/CNI-ANNOUNCE/Message/113246.html a lot of hard work].  

So who wrote what?

=== Citation Example ===

Dong, Liang, Jiang, Hongrui. (2007). Autonomous microfluidics with stimuli-responsive hydrogels. Soft Matter, 3(10), 1223-1230.

From this Citation, we know these truths:

  * AuthorStrings: "Dong, Liang" and "Jiang, Hongrui"
  * Co-Authorship: "Dong, Liang" and "Jiang, Hongrui" wrote this article together
  * Year: "2007"
  * Publication: "Soft Matter"
  * Title keywords: "microfluidics" and "stimuli"

=== BibApp's Author Authority Workflow ===

I'll use myself as an example:

User name: Eric William Larson

I login to the BibApp for the first time and the website asks me to select my Author names.  I type in my last name to filter the AuthorString index.  Here's what I see:

Potential Author variants:

  * Larson, D
  * ---
  * Larson, E
  * Larson, EW
  * Larson, E.W.
  * Larson, Eric W.
  * Larson, Eric WM.
  * Larson, Eric William
  * ---
  * Larson, F

Maybe all the {{{Larson, E*}}} AuthorStrings are correct (hypothetically, I have published under all these name variants), so I select the checkbox next to AuthorString to create a new PenName association record, tying my Person record to each AuthorString.  Lastly, I select one of these variants as my "preferred" name: Larson, E.W.

Now I have created 6 PenNames for myself (Person 1: Eric William Larson).  Anytime a new Citation is entered into the BibApp for any of those AuthorStrings {{{Larson, E*}}}, the BibApp will automatically create an Authorship row, creating the association between the new Citation and me (Person: Eric William Larson).

== It's not _that_ simple! ==

The above example works great if no one else "claims" one of my selected PenNames.  When Erica Larson (Person 2: Erica Larson) enters the application and selects "Larson, E" as one of her PenNames, what should we do?

Every Authorship row, associating a Person to a Citation needs to have a "status" and "score" attribute.

Status options: "calculated", "verified", "denied"
Score: integer representing "how certain we feel the record is valid"

Now to handle Erica's case:

  # Create Authorship rows associating Erica (Person 2) to all "Larson, E" AuthorString related Citations.
  # For each Authorship record above set the Authorship.status attribute to "calculated"

Now two people claiming the "Larson, E" AuthorString have Authorship records for some Citations... this could be correct if the same AuthorString appeared twice in the citation (probably unlikely).

== Who's the real author? ==

Authorship "status" and "score" help us clean up the mess.  In the BibApp, there are three ways to create Authorship records:

  # Generic citation batch import (no Person associated)
  # Targeted citation batch import (imported for a Person)
  # Single citation insert (add for a Person)

If we're adding a targeted batch import or a single citation via a web form, we're simultaneously verifying the Authorship record connecting the Person to the Citation.

If we're generically adding citations to application, we need to start (smartly) guessing who the real author is.  Take a look at the flow chart below.  This picture illustrates our plans for machine scoring the authorships we batch import:
