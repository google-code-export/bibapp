= SVN Management for !BibApp =

== Introduction ==

This page serves as a guide for developers working with !BibApp's SVN to update or modify code, gems or plugins.

== Gem Management ==

All required Gems to run !BibApp are managed in the `/config/environment.rb` as Gem Dependencies (a new feature of Rails as of version 2.1).

To upgrade a version of a Gem, you need only update the dependency listed in `/config/environment.rb`.  For example, to update Hpricot to *minimally require* version 0.6 instead of 0.5, you'd change the following:
{{{
config.gem "hpricot", :version=>"~>0.5", :source=>"http://code.whytheluckystiff.net"
}}}
To this:
{{{
config.gem "hpricot", :version=>"~>0.6", :source=>"http://code.whytheluckystiff.net"
}}}
Notice the change from `~>0.5` to `~>0.6`.  

Here's a quick guide of how versions are handled within `environment.rb`:
  * `"0.5"` = require version 0.5 *exactly*
  * `">=0.5"` = require version 0.5 or greater
  * `"~>0.5"` = require version 0.5 or greater, but don't allow next major version (1.0).

REMEMBER: after changing a gem version within `environment.rb`, you need to run `rake gems:install` to install that new gem version!
