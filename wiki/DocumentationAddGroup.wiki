<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

This page describes how to add and edit groups in !BibApp.

Note that as of !BibApp 1.01 it is not possible to upload multiple groups via the user interface.

As you start this process, it is useful to have:

 * a list of the groups you want to add including parent or child groups; and
 * the URLs for homepages of those groups (if applicable)

==Who Can Add Groups?==

  * Sitewide administrators
  * Sitewide editors
  * Admins of Groups
  * Editors of Groups

==Who Can Edit Groups?==

  * Sitewide administrators
  * Sitewide editors
  * Admins of Groups
  * Editors of Groups

==Adding a Group==

1. Log into your !BibApp install.

2. You can add groups from two locations:

  * Click the Admin tab, then Group, then Add a Person (only available to system administrators and editors)
  * Click the People tab, then Add a Person (in the bar under the main tabs)

3. At the new Group page you can add the name of your group, a description, and URL. You can also add the parent group if there is one. For example, a department may belong to a college (as in below).
