This page describes how to add and edit groups in !BibApp.

Note that as of !BibApp 1.01 it is not possible to upload multiple groups via the user interface.

As you start this process, it is useful to have:

 * a list of the groups you want to add including parent or child groups; and
 * the URLs for homepages of those groups (if applicable)
