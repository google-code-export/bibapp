#summary Installation Instructions for BibApp -- STILL A DRAFT

== Introduction ==

!BibApp is a [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on Rails] 2.0 web application.  If you are familiar with installing Ruby on Rails applications, BibApp should be no different!  If this is your first time with Ruby on Rails, don't worry...we've tried to make things easy on you.

At a basic level, Ruby on Rails applications require the following:
  * A Web server
  * A Database
  * Ruby and..
  * Rails

Currently, because of a small development team, we've some recommendations for your Rails setup for !BibApp.  You may be able to get away with other Ruby on Rails setups, but we haven't verified they all work with !BibApp, yet. 

== Software Pre-requisities ==

!BibApp should run on any Operating System.  Currently we've had it successfully running on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows XP.

!BibApp *requires* the following software to function properly:
  * [http://www.ruby-lang.org/ Ruby] 1.8.5 or later
    * Check your version by running `ruby --version` at command line
  * [http://www.rubygems.org/ RubyGems] 1.0.1 or later
    * Check your version by running `gem --version` at command line
  * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Java] 1.5 or later (_note:_ Java 1.5 is also sometimes called Java 5.x, similarly Java 1.6 is also called 6.x)
    * Check your version by running `java -version` at command line

!BibApp gives you a few options when it comes to your database.  However, we currently *recommend* you install _one_ of the following:
  * [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] 4.1 or 5.0
  * [http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] 8.x (7.4 may also work)

_Optional:_ If you want to be able to pull down !BibApp directly from our !GoogleCode site, you may also wish to install [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion (svn)].

That's everything you need to get started...

== Get Started with !BibApp ==

Before we jump in, it's worth explaining a bit about what software !BibApp has bundled (Rails uses the term "frozen") within it.  You don't need to understand what everything is doing, but we just want to let you know it's there! When you download !BibApp, it already comes pre-packaged with the following:
  * [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Rails] 2.0.2
  * [http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ Solr]
  * A variety of [http://www.rubygems.org/ Ruby Gems] and Rails Plugins

=== Ruby Gem Pre-requisites ===

Unfortunately, we cannot bundle every Ruby Gem within !BibApp.  We've tried to minimize your need to install Gems, but there are still a few you must install:
  * Database Driver Gem - based on your database of choice
    * For MySQL - install the `mysql` gem:  
     {{{ gem install mysql }}}
    * For PostgreSQL - install the `postgresql` gem:
     {{{ gem install postgresql }}}
  * Ruby Web Server - [http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ Mongrel] is recommended
     {{{ 
     gem install mongrel 
     gem install mongrel_cluster 
     }}}
  * [http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ HPricot] - an HTML parser used by !BibApp
     {{{ gem install hpricot }}}
